## Introduction

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of generative model that is used to learn the underlying distribution of the data. It is a powerful tool for learning complex data distributions and generating new data samples. The key idea behind VAE is to learn a latent space representation of the data that is as close as possible to the original data distribution. The VAE model consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes in the input data and outputs a mean and variance vector that represents the latent space representation of the data. The decoder takes in the latent space representation and outputs a reconstruction of the original data. The goal of the VAE is to learn a latent space representation that is as close as possible to the original data distribution. The VAE model can be trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent.

## Architecture

The VAE model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes in the input data and outputs a mean and variance vector that represents the latent space representation of the data. The decoder takes in the latent space representation and outputs a reconstruction of the original data. The encoder and decoder are typically neural networks with multiple layers. The encoder takes in the input data and outputs a mean and variance vector that represents the latent space representation of the data. The decoder takes in the latent space representation and outputs a reconstruction of the original data.

## Training

The VAE model can be trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. The encoder and decoder are trained separately using the reconstruction loss and the KL divergence loss. The reconstruction loss measures the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data. The KL divergence loss measures the difference between the learned distribution and the prior distribution. The KL divergence loss is used to ensure that the learned distribution is as close as possible to the prior distribution. The goal of the training process is to minimize the reconstruction loss and maximize the KL divergence loss.
